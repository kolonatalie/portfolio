153 days ago, I created my very first GitHub account and was hit with a wave of panic. Clone? Push? Pull? Stage? I had no idea what any of it meant. It felt like trying to read a foreign language. But that moment of confusion was the very beginning of my journey into frontend development.

Today, I'm launching my new <a href="../" target="_blank">portfolio website</a> and this very blog, both hosted on GitHub Pages. And I’m incredibly proud of the progress I've made.

Over the past five months, I've dived headfirst into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along the way, I've created <a href="https://github.com/kolonatalie/frontend-practice-projects" target="_blank">dedicated repositories</a> for every single project and coding challenge.

#### This blog, "Frontend from Scratch" 

is a way for me to document my career-switching journey. I want to share the highs, the lows, the frustrations, and the triumphs. More than that, I want to show how I think, learn, and solve problems. 

And **for fellow beginners**, I hope this blog shows you that you're not alone in the chaos, and maybe, it will even introduce you to some new tools and features along the way.

*Stay tuned, it's going to be a wild ride.*

#### P.S.: The very first piece of advice I got was:

> Write a simple README.md file about yourself on Github and link to your social profiles. It's the first thing people see when they visit your page. **Make yourself shine** ✨
